> Performance first, feature-rich universal Fortnite private server backend written in Go.

## Overview

- **Single File** It will embed all of the external files inside of one executable! This allows the backend to be ran anywhere with no setup _(after initial config)_!
- **Blazingly Fast** Written in Go and built upon Fast HTTP, it is extremely fast and can handle any profile action in milliseconds with its caching system.
- **Automatic Profile Changes** Automatically keeps track of profile changes exactly so any external changes are displayed in-game on the next action.

## What's up next?

- Interaction with a Game Server to handle **Event Tracking** for player statistics and challenges. This will be a very large task as a new specialised game server will need to be created.
- After the game server addition, a **Matchmaking System** will be added to match players together for a game. It will use a bin packing algorithm to ensure that games are filled as much as possible.

And once battle royale is completed ...

- **Save The World**

## Feature List

- **Battle Pass** Claim a free battle pass and level it up with challenges or buy tiers with V-Bucks.

- **Automatic Item Shop** Will automatically update the item shop for the day, for all builds.
- **Support A Creator 5%** Use any display name and each purchase will give them 5% of the vbucks spent.
- **XMPP** For interacting with friends, parties and gifting.
- **Friends** On every build, this will allow for adding, removing and blocking friends.
- **Party System V2** This replaces the legacy xmpp driven party system.
- **Gifting** Of any item shop entry to any friend.
